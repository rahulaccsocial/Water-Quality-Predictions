# ðŸŒŠ Water Quality Predictions
ðŸš€ Overview
This project predicts water potability using machine learning, aiming to support public health efforts by classifying water as safe or unsafe to drink. Using physicochemical attributes (e.g., pH, hardness, chloramines, turbidity), models determine whether water meets drinking standards.

ðŸ“Š Dataset & Features
Source: publicly available water potability data

Key Attributes:

pH, Hardness, Solids (TDS), Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity

Organic Carbon, Trihalomethanes, Turbidity, Potability (0 = Not Potable, 1 = Potable)

ðŸ§ª Pipeline
Data Cleaning & Imputation: Handle missing values and outliers

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Distribution plots, correlations, and potability breakdown

Feature Engineering: Scaling (e.g., StandardScaler), optional feature selection

Model Training: Compare classifiers:

Logistic Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost

Evaluation: Metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix

Model Selection: Choose best model while addressing class imbalance

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Logistic Regression	0.70	0.68	0.72	0.70
Random Forest	0.74	0.73	0.76	0.74
SVM	0.76	0.75	0.78	0.77
XGBoost	0.75	0.74	0.76	0.75

ðŸŽ¯ Key Takeaways
Clean data and thoughtful feature engineering are essential.

SVM delivers the strongest balance of accuracy and generalization.

A Flask web app enhances accessibility for non-technical users.

ðŸ“Œ Future Improvements
Address class imbalance with oversampling (SMOTE) or ensemble methods

Hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV) for models

Add more features (e.g., season, location) if available

Deploy app containerized (Docker + Heroku/AWS)

Build an API for integration with IoT or mobile clients
